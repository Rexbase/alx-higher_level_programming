# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

Welcome to the "0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples" module! In this module, we'll explore two important data structures in Python: lists and tuples. These data structures are versatile and essential for managing and organizing collections of items.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the concepts of lists and tuples in Python.
- Create and manipulate lists and tuples to store and manage collections of data.
- Learn about indexing, slicing, and basic operations on lists and tuples.
- Compare the differences between lists and tuples and when to use each.
