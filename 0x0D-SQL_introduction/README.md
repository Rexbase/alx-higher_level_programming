## What is SQL?

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used to communicate with relational database management systems (RDBMS). It is a powerful tool for managing, querying, and manipulating data in structured databases.

- Origins and History of SQL
- RDBMS and SQL
- Importance of SQL in Database Management

## Relational Databases

Understand the concept of relational databases and how they organize and store data in tables with defined relationships.

- Tables and Rows (Tuples)
- Primary Keys and Foreign Keys
- Normalization and Denormalization
- Indexes in Databases

## Basic SQL Syntax

Learn the fundamental SQL syntax elements required to create, update, and retrieve data from a relational database.

- SQL Statements: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- SQL Clauses: WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
- SQL Functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN
- SQL Operators: AND, OR, NOT

## SQL Data Types

Explore the common data types used to define the structure and format of data in SQL databases.

- Numeric Data Types: INT, FLOAT, DECIMAL
- Character Data Types: CHAR, VARCHAR
- Date and Time Data Types: DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP
- Binary Data Types: BLOB, CLOB

## CRUD Operations

Master the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing data in a database.

- INSERT: Adding Data to Tables
- SELECT: Retrieving Data
- UPDATE: Modifying Data
- DELETE: Removing Data

## Querying Databases

Learn to create complex SQL queries to extract specific data from databases using conditions and criteria.

- Filtering Data with WHERE
- Sorting Results with ORDER BY
- Grouping Data with GROUP BY
- Combining Data from Multiple Tables

## SQL JOINs

Understand how SQL JOIN operations are used to combine data from multiple tables in a relational database.

- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN
- Self-Joins and Cross Joins
- Subqueries and Derived Tables
- Join Best Practices

## Database Design

Discover the principles of effective database design, including normalization, schema design, and best practices.

- Database Schema and Tables
- Relationships and Keys
- Denormalization and Performance
- Indexing and Optimization

## SQL Best Practices

Explore best practices for writing efficient and maintainable SQL code.

- Avoiding SQL Injection
- Using Prepared Statements
- Writing Clear and Readable SQL
- Efficient Query Execution

Happy querying!
