# 0x0B Python Input/Output

## Description
This project focuses on input and output operations in Python. You will learn how to read from and write to files, handle exceptions related to file operations, and work with JSON data.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use file I/O in Python.
- Handle exceptions related to file operations.
- Read and write text and binary files.
- Work with JSON data.

## Files
- **0-read_file.py**: A Python script that reads a text file (`my_file.txt`) and prints its content to the standard output.

- **1-number_of_lines.py**: A Python script that returns the number of lines in a text file (`my_file.txt`).

- **2-read_lines.py**: A Python script that reads and prints specific lines from a text file (`my_file.txt`).

- **3-write_file.py**: A Python script that writes a string to a text file (`my_file.txt`). If the file doesn't exist, it creates it.

- **4-append_write.py**: A Python script that appends a string to the end of a text file (`my_file.txt`). If the file doesn't exist, it creates it.

- **5-to_json_string.py**: A Python function that converts a Python object to a JSON string.

- **6-from_json_string.py**: A Python function that converts a JSON string to a Python object.

- **7-save_to_json_file.py**: A Python function that writes a Python object to a text file (`my_file.json`) in JSON representation.

- **8-load_from_json_file.py**: A Python function that reads a JSON file (`my_file.json`) and returns a Python object.

## Usage
You can run the Python scripts in this project using the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the Python script you want to run.

For example:

```bash
python 0-read_file.py
```

## Testing
To test the functions in this project, you can create your test files or use the provided test files and run the scripts to verify their functionality.
