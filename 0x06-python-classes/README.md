# 0x06. Python - Classes

Welcome to the "0x06. Python - Classes" module! In this module, we'll dive into the world of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. Classes are the foundation of OOP, and they allow you to create your own data types with attributes and methods.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the concepts of classes and objects in Python.
- Create and use classes to model real-world entities and their behaviors.
- Define attributes and methods within classes.
- Implement constructors and destructors.
- Work with class inheritance and polymorphism.

## Introduction to Classes

Understand the concept of classes in Python and how they enable you to create custom data types.

## Creating and Using Classes

Learn how to define and use classes, create instances of objects, and access their attributes and methods.

## Attributes and Methods

Explore the concepts of attributes (instance variables) and methods (functions within classes) and how they define the behavior of objects.

## Constructors and Destructors

Discover constructors (`__init__` method) and destructors (`__del__` method) and how they initialize and clean up class instances.

## Class Inheritance

Learn about class inheritance and how to create derived classes that inherit attributes and methods from base classes.

## Polymorphism

Explore the concept of polymorphism, where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common base class.

## Exercises

Practice your understanding of classes and OOP through hands-on exercises. Apply the concepts you've learned to model and solve real-world problems.


Happy learning and mastering classes in Python!
