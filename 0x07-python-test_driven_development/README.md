# Python Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Project 0x07

This project explores the concept of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. It consists of a set of Python functions that are developed using TDD principles, where tests are written before the code implementation.

## Introduction

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. In this project, we apply TDD principles to develop a set of Python functions. Each function is associated with a set of test cases, ensuring that the code behaves as expected.

## Project Requirements

To run and test the code in this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x installed on your computer.
- A code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x07-python-test_driven_development
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x07-python-tdd
   ```

3. Install any required dependencies:

   ```bash
   # If there are any project-specific dependencies, mention them here.
   ```

## Usage

In this section, provide instructions on how to use the project. You can include examples of how to run the tests or use the Python functions developed using TDD. Here's a general structure:

### Running Tests

To run the tests for this project, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Using the Functions

Provide examples of how to use the Python functions developed using TDD:

```python
# Import the module containing the functions
from mymodule import my_function

# Use the function
result = my_function(argument1, argument2)
print(result)
```
